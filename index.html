      <p>This document aims to identify representative use cases of where WebViews are being used, regardless of the platform and type of device they're used on, identify the issues that arise from these usages and determine whether these issues can be addressed through improvements to the Web Platform, the surrounding ecosystem (e.g. documentation, testing frameworks) or through other mechanisms.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The WebView Community Group aims to identify, understand and reduce the issues arising from the use of software components (typically referred as WebViews) that are used to render Web technology-based content outside of a Web browser (Native Apps, MiniApps, etc).</p>
	<p>This document contains sections describing the use cases that were contributed by multiple authors. Since this document is a group note, additional use cases will be added in future revisions of this document.</p>

        <h2>Load a WebView Page</h2>

            <dt>Motivation</dt>
            <dd>
            It is quite common to use WebView in Native App development, due to WebView’s benefit of cross-platform interoperability. But the page loading performance of WebView cannot satisfy Native App well, which means the loading of a WebView page is quite slower than loading a Native page.
            <br>
            <br>
            The below is WebView page loading, it firstly shows the white screen.
            
            <figure>
                <img alt="WebView page loading" src="./images/Load-WebView-Page.gif" width="400">
                <figcaption>
                  WebView page loading
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            But for the Native page loading as shown below, it shows the skeleton immediately, which gives a better user experience compared with WebView.
            
            <figure>
                <img alt="Native page loading" src="./images/Load-Native-Page.gif" width="400">
                <figcaption>
                  Native page loading
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            Therefore, how to enhance the loading performance of WebView page needs to be addressed.

                    <li>WebView provider: browsers, deciders on how to enhance WebView</li>
                    <li>WebView user: Native App or MiniApp which rely on WebView to render pages</li>
                    <li>End user: users of the Native App or MiniApp are indirectly using the pages and functions implemented by WebView</li>

            <dt>Analysis</dt>
            <dd>
            The reason of long white screen is due to serial execution in loading a WebView page. The duration of white screen directly depends on the time cost from routing intercept to JS download & parse & exec as described in the following figure.

            <dt>How is the issue solved in the Browser, and what’s more is needed?</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the Browser: Prefetch, Preload and Next are used to pre-request resources (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Img, etc.), but they are not supported or only partly supported by WebView.</li>
                    <li>What’s more: how to pre-request the data (JSON, XML, etc.)
                    <br>
                    Take e-commerce App as example. WebView is used to render the page of product list and product info. So, a request to fetch the data is needed, and the data is described and transferred in the format of JSON or XML. Sometimes, user info is also carried in the request, to obtain the personalized product info. If the data can be pre-requested, the performance of loading a product page can be increased.

        <h2>Requests/responses sharing and proxy between Native and WebView</h2>

            <dd>
            In a hybrid Native/WebView app, some Native app may load first-party website or third-party website through WebView. So, the Native app and the WebView may make the exact same calls in first-party business, or Native app handles the resource request on behalf of WebView and the corresponding response data returned to WebView can even be different with what is received by Native from the backend server. Also, not all requests want to be proxied through Native, WebView user want to proxy a small number of requests locally to load offline resources.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some scenarios:
                <ol>
                    <li>Document access control: it is expected to manage the access control of Web access documents, allowing different users to access documents of different levels.</li>
                    <li>Security firewall: In order to meet compliance requirements, network engineers want to audit requests within the app, and do not allow insecure requests to be sent on the web.</li>
                    <li>Transcoder: In special scenarios, we may need to convert GIF images to JPEG images to send to reduce traffic, and may also need to translate documents to meet communication needs in different language scenarios. For example, it's hard for a user to communicating in English. When communicating, the user can type Chinese and it will be automatically translated into English.</li>
                    <li>Anonymous: Some users may have higher requirements for the privacy of Web access, requiring that requests within the Web must remove identity features (such as client IP address, From header, Referer header, cookie, URI session ID), providing a high degree of privacy and anonymity.</li>
                    <li>Reducing network requests: A hybrid app (in the sense that some screens are native code and other screens are Webviews) may make some of the same network requests (HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or other network connections supported by webviews such as Web Sockets and WebRTC) in both the native screens and the webview screens. Being able to easily share those responses between native and web (while maintaining proper HTTP cache semantics) would reduce redundant requests, saving end-users bandwidth and reducing server traffic.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <aside class="note">
                    <p>
                        The open questions on handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) & whether we should distinguish access between first-party and third-party content needs to be further considered.
                    </p>

                    <li>WebView user: Native Business rely on WebView to send internal request, or load offline resource</li>
                    <li>End user: users of the App save bandwidth by not having to make duplicate calls</li>
                </ul>
            </dd>

            <dt>Analysis</dt>
            <dd>
            This is currently even possible in some way, but it is not a recommended pattern. So making this a standard that is easy to use for both Native and WebView developers would be a win for both groups.
